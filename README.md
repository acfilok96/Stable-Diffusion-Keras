# Stable-Diffusion-With-Keras
Here we will see how to generate novel images based on a text prompt using the KerasCV implementation of stability.ai's text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion.

Stable Diffusion is a powerful, open-source text-to-image generation model. While there exist multiple open-source implementations that allow you to easily create images from textual prompts, KerasCV's offers a few distinct advantages. These include XLA compilation and mixed precision support, which together achieve state-of-the-art generation speed.
